## About
This tagging extension is basically a glorified search/replace for Strings in Basecamp tasks. You can set your tags, labels and colors by right-clicking on the icon and selecting `Options`.

## Installing
* Download the package into a folder.
* Open your Chrome extensions via Settings
* Check `developer mode`
* Click `Load unpacked extension`
* Select the folder you just downloaded the package to.

## What this does not do.

This _currently_ does not allow you to tag items, as stated above this is a glorified search/replace. So you
still need to 'edit' basecamp task titles and input your own tags, this just makes it prettier and easier to read.

## Planned features
* Allowing tagging after clicking edit ( auto-insert tags )
* More? Idk, make an issue, let's see!
